# Looksy: A Virtual Dressing Room üéÄ

A web-based application that enables users to virtually try on various t-shirt designs in real time using a webcam. The application leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques for pose detection and dynamic image overlay.

## Features

- **Real-time Pose Detection:** Utilizes Mediapipe for detecting and tracking body landmarks.
- **Dynamic Image Overlay:** Automatically resizes and positions t-shirt designs on users based on their body posture.
- **Interactive Buttons:** Enables users to switch between different t-shirt designs.
- **Web-based Interface:** Hosted using Flask for a seamless experience.

## Demo

Include screenshots or a short video showcasing the application in action:
